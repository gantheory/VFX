Environment: Matlab ( R2016b )

How to execute ?
  If you just want to see how 'artifact.png' produces, just execute 'src/hdr.m'.
  The parameters in 'src/hdr.m' are used for images in 'input_image/'.
  'src/hdr.m' uses HDR assembling( Paul ) and the tonemap() function of Matlab.

  If you want to check the implementations of other algorithms we implement.
  Just check other files in 'src/'. Notice that if you want to use those files
  for any reasons, you should adjust parameters of them.
