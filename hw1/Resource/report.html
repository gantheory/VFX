  <h3>HDR Assembling (Paul E. Devebec)</h3 >
  <p>We use Matlab( R2016b ) as the programming language to do this project. The Assembling algorithm we implemented is basically what slides and [ 1 ] say. But rather than choosing pixels by hands, we chose those points, which we use to recover response curves, randomly. Then we apply the function in gsolve.m to each channel, and get response curves. At the end, we can use these three response curvers to get the approimate energy on each pixel for each channel.</p>
  <h3>Bonus</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Image alignment </li>
    <p> We implemented Medium Threshold Bitmap(MTB) to do the image alignment. First, translate rgb images into green channel. Next, calculate the median of the image. If the pixel value > median -> white, else black. Last, recursively call the function which scales the images by 2, and tries the 9 possibilities to find the optimal offset. </p>
    <li>Robertson's algorithm
      <p> This algorithm aims to estimate the camera response with given exposure time t and pixel values of different images with different exposure time. Assumes that the camera response function will typically be more sensitive to the middle middle of it's output range, so we design the weighting function as a Gaussian-like function. First,, assume g(Z) is know, optimize for Ei; next, assume Ei is known and optimize for g(Z). Continue for a few iterations until the objective function converges.  
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>weight = exp(-4 * (yij - 127.5)^2/ (127.5^2) )</li>
          <li>initial I(m) = m / 128</li>
          <li>iteration = 7</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
    </li>

    <li> Tone Mapping </li> 
      <p>The purpose of tone mapping algorithm is to transform an hdr file to a picture that normal screens can display correctly. The main idea is that we get a new [ R', G', B' ] from L'/L x [ R, G, B ], where L' is a new luminance from tone mapping algorithm, and L is luminance from an hdr file.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Bilateral Filter </li>
          <p>We implement the algorithm in [ 2 ]. The high level idea is following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>input intensity = 0.212671 * R + 0.715160 * G + 0.072169 * B</li>
            <li>r = R/(input intensity), g = G/input intensity, b = B/input intensity</li>
            <li>log( base ) = Bilateral( log( input intensity ) )</li>
            <li>log( detail ) = log( input intensity ) - log( base )</li>
            <li>log( output intensity ) = log( base ) * compressionfactor + log( detail ) - log( absolute_scale )</li>
            <li>R output = r * e ^ log( output intensity ), G output = g * e ^ log( output intensity ), B output = b * e ^ log( output intensity )</li>
            <li>Parameters we use are the same as those in [ 2 ].</li>
          </p>
          </ol>
          <li> Photographic Tone Reproduction  algorithm </li>
          <p>  The main idea of this algorithm is to make the dark pixels darker, and the bright pixels brighter. This algorithm includes two kinds of operator, one is global operator, and the other one is local operator.
            <ol>
              <li>For global operator, high luminances are scaled by 1/L, while low luminances are scaled by 1, so bright pixels can stay in displayable range. Different key values may lead to different luminance.</li> 
              <li>For local operator, this algorithm assumes that areas with different exposure is often bounded by sharp contrast, so, it tries to find the largest surrounding area without sharp contrast. If the variance of the Gaussian Filter we chose is too big, than some dark lines will appear in the images.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
            The parameters we used are shown as follows: 
          <ol>
            <li>key value a = 0.7</li>
            <li>phi = 8</li>
            <li>epsilon = 0.03</li>
            <li>lum_w = 0.27R + 0.67G + 0.06B</li>
            <li>s = 1.6^k</li>
            <li>alpha1 = 0.1</li>
            <li>alpha2 = 0.1 * 1.6</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
  </ol>

    <p>According to the paper[4], if we set the scale too large, then there will be some black lines on the image. The alpha value of the first image is 0.1, and the alpha value of the second image is 0.35, which shows that we should choose alpha carefully.</p>
    <p>If we compare two operators of Photographic tone reproduction, we can find that for local operator, details inside the dark are clearer than global operator.
